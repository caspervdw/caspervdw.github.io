title: Multithreading PyGEOS
---

In this blogpost I describe how to make use of multithreading in the latest version of PyGEOS (version 0.8).
This improves the performance of PyGEOS computations with a factor of 4 on most systems.
For information about PyGEOS, please read my [previous blogpost](https://caspervdw.github.io/Introducing-Pygeos/), or consult the [documentation](https://pygeos.readthedocs.org).


## Multithreading

Multithreading is a technique to parallelize workload. In contrast to multiprocessing, resources are shared amongst threads: the threads use the same RAM. Because of this, the overhead of multithreading is much smaller than of multiprocessing. However, for Python code, mulithreading is blocked by the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL).

Luckily, PyGEOS runs mostly in C++ (GEOS). In PyGEOS 0.8 we now safely lift the GIL, so that you can now take advantage of multithreading.

## Example

We are going to dive in straight away and measure the distance between 120000 points and a complex geometry.
We vary the amount of threads and correspondingly reduce the compute 'portions' each thread receives.
The total work stays the same for all tests.

```python
import pygeos
import dask.array
import numpy as np
import time

# array with pygeos geometries
arr =  pygeos.points(np.random.randn(120000, 2) * 100)
# complex geometry
poly = pygeos.buffer(pygeos.multipoints(np.random.randn(20, 2) * 100), 0.2, quadsegs=20)

time_mean = []

for n in (1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8):
    # define the operation
    arr_dask = dask.array.from_array(arr, chunks=int(len(arr) / n))
    res = arr_dask.map_blocks(pygeos.distance, poly, dtype=float)

    # run the benchmark 10 times
    times = []
    for _ in range(10):
        before = time.time()
        if n == 1:
            res.compute(scheduler="single-threaded", optimize_graph=False)
        else:
            res.compute(scheduler="threads", optimize_graph=False, num_workers=n)
        times.append(time.time() - before)

    time_mean.append(np.mean(times))
```

Note that this example uses [dask](https://dask.org/) for the multithreading.
This is just for convenience: this example runs just as well using the Python built-in ``threading`` module.
The results:


| threads | compute time [s] |
|---------|------------------|
| 1       | 3.03             |
| 2       | 1.33             |
| 3       | 0.90             |
| 4       | 0.73             |
| 6       | 0.77             |
| 8       | 0.74             |


What we see is that the multithreading improves performance with a factor of 4. This is no surprise: my CPU has 4 cores. 

For comparison: in PyGEOS 0.7 the computation takes about 3 seconds, no mather how many threads you use. That is because of the GIL.

## Technicalities

Of course, the [GIL](https://wiki.python.org/moin/GlobalInterpreterLock) is there for a reason. Python depends on it. You cannot use Python when there is no GIL. So, after making sure that there were no Python C API calls from our extension code, we wrapped our C code in ``Py_BEGIN_ALLOW_THREADS`` and ``Py_END_ALLOW_THREADS``, which released the GIL (see for example [the distance function](https://github.com/pygeos/pygeos/blob/77123ff4f8c7d065db49b045df3f3796a60d40f1/src/ufuncs.c#L848)).

However, this was not all. In PyGEOS we are in the situation that we loop over an array with Python objects. So we do in fact make use of Python objects while the GIL is not in place! Of course we could collect the underlying C structs in a seperate loop (while holding the GIL), but this appeared to be not necessary. Access to the ``GEOSGeometry`` is done via a static attribute ``geom->ptr`` on each Python Geometry object. So to retrieve the object, we do not actually use the Python interpreter.

So are we safe? No. We were able to crash the interpeter by constructing a test with one thread doing a computation on the ndarray, and the other thread deleting objects from the ndarray. This lead to a Segfault; the first thread was trying to access a geometry that did not exist anymore.

Therefore, to guarantee the existence of the python objects during the GIL release, we wrapped each function with a decorator that makes the ndarray read-only ([link](https://github.com/pygeos/pygeos/blob/77123ff4f8c7d065db49b045df3f3796a60d40f1/pygeos/decorators.py#L33)). So, during the functions that release the GIL internally, the ndarrays are locked.

## Outlook and related projects

As of June 2020 [geopandas](https://github.com/geopandas/geopandas/) includes an optional support for PyGEOS. So the performance benefit of multithreading can also be exploited through combining dask with geopandas (and pygeos). This is being explored currently in the following libraries, both having a different use case in mind:

 - [dask-geopandas](https://github.com/jsignell/dask-geopandas)
 - [dask-geomodeling](https://github.com/nens/dask-geomodeling)

The work on merging pygeos with shapely is also continuing (thanks to Joris Van den Bossche). Check out the [RFC](https://github.com/shapely/shapely-rfc/pull/1) and the upcoming pull requests at [shapely](https://github.com/Toblerity/Shapely).


## Summary

PyGEOS 0.8 allows multithreading, giving a factor 4 of performance on most systems.

Please let us know if there are any issues, or better: if you have a nice use case that you like to share at https://github.com/pygeos/pygeos.
