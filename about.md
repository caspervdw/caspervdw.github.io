I am currently working as a lead software developer at Nelen & Schuurmans, primarily on the Python backend of [Lizard](https://demo.lizard.net), a data platform for the physical environment.

My background is a mix of different branches of science: I started out with chemistry and went via physics to software development. Especially during my PhD ([thesis](http://caspervdwel.nl/thesis.pdf)) I focused on data analysis, tracking colloidal particles in 3D microscopic images on lipid membranes.

Open source projects I am actively contributing to:
- [dask-geomodeling](https://dask-geomodeling.readthedocs.org)
- [PIMS](http://soft-matter.github.io/pims)
- [PyGEOS](https://pygeos.readthedocs.org)
- [trackpy](http://soft-matter.github.io/trackpy)
